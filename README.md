Advent of Code Solutions in Multiple Programming Languages
==========================================================

This repository is a collection of solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles, implemented in as many programming languages as possible. The Advent of Code is an annual event that takes place in December, consisting of a series of 25 daily programming puzzles, released each day leading up to Christmas.

The aim of this repository is to provide solutions to each of these puzzles in different programming languages, showcasing the different approaches and techniques used to solve them.

Getting Started
